Problem: Emoji Maze Escape

Task:

You’re given a grid (2D list) full of emojis.

🚪 → exit

🟩 → path

🟥 → wall

🐱 → starting point

You have to write a program that finds the shortest path from the cat to the exit and prints the steps as coordinates.

Example grid:

grid = [
    ["🐱", "🟩", "🟥", "🟩"],
    ["🟩", "🟩", "🟥", "🟩"],
    ["🟥", "🟩", "🟩", "🟩"],
    ["🟩", "🟩", "🟥", "🚪"]
]


Output:

[(0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)]
