Problem: Bank Account Simulator with Interest and Transactions

Scenario:

You’re building a mini banking system. Each account has:

accountNumber (String or int)

accountHolder (String)

balance (double)

transactions (list of past transactions)

Your program should allow:

Deposits – add money to the account.

Withdrawals – remove money if enough balance exists.

Interest Application – at the end of each month, apply a certain interest rate.

Transaction History – print all deposits, withdrawals, and interest applied.
